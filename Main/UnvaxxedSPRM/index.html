                    <p> Unvaxxed $SPRM is a groundbreaking meme token on the Solana blockchain, launched on December 21st, 2024, at 1 PM EST. Right now the whole market is filled with junk. It's leaking everywhere. We seek to put an end to this corruption. Here, we’re bringing back the gold standard. A meme so potent it can get your wallet (and your friends’ wallets) pregnant. This is the power of the omnipotent $SPRM! Hold onto your seed! </p>

            <h2>What does it all MEME?</h2>
            <p> We’re not just making a meme, we’re making a statement. Realtalk: whether you knew 2020 was a psyop then or you’re waking up to that now, saying you’re holding onto Unvaxxed $SPRM is your way of siding with a happier, healthier humanity. 

This isn’t divide and conquer (there’s enough of that low vibe out there). Instead we’re here to unite and prosper! 

UNVAXX is our way of reclaiming that word that was used negatively and here we mean to empower it and flip it to mean to ‘detox’ and to ‘purify’, which everyone can do. 

As people were all in this together. It’s us (humanity) vs. the corrupt corporate interests.

    <h2>Detox Protocol</h2>
    <p class="disclaimer">
        This information is a total joke, please DO NOT FOLLOW ANY OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS HERE! None of this has been evaluated by all the wonderful world agencies that totally do have your best interest at heart and want you to heal and thrive. For information and entertainment purposes only!
    </p>
    <div class="detox-steps">
        <div class="step capsule alternate">
            Step 1: Buy and hold UNVAXXED $SPRM
        </div>
        <p class="step-explanation">
This is a crucial step. Really. This token was created with a powerful intention to provide healing to all those who have it. The collective intention of purity is infused in the very fabric of this token. So holding it makes you already the beneficiary of
 healing energy. We may or may not have a powerful team of quantum energy healers making sure this is true. Wink wink. $SPRM!!!        </p>
        <div class="step capsule">
            Step 2: WATCH YOUR MIND AND THOUGHTS
        </div>
        <p class="step-explanation">
           You must realize that you have the power of healing within you. There is NOTHING that is too much for you to heal from. So rid yourself of the belief that your body has been permanently altered. You can heal from anything. You have to trust this with every fiber of your being, 
even when current circumstances seem to indicate otherwise. YOU GOT THIS. Know it. Know it in your heart that healing is not only possible, it is here, now. Vitality, purity, clarity, all of it is there within you. Trust this. 
        </p>
        <div class="step capsule alternate">
            Step 3: Lifestyle
        </div>
        <p class="step-explanation">
Everywhere you look, everybody claims their diet is the best one. Nobody seem to agree except on one aspect. The elimination of toxic, processed food. Whatever diet you choose to follow to detox, this one aspect is going to bring you loads of benefits. 
        FASTING is another big one. Autophagy has been linked to the processing of the spike protein, and so by fasting you are letting your body recycle the toxic stuff into something beneficial for you. 
        STRESS:  Stress is truly infamous when it comes to reducing the healing abilities of your body. Do everything you can to aid in relaxation of your body and mind. Be it meditation, prayer, singing, dancing, artistic expressions, anything that make your level of stress reduce is going to assist you tremendously. 
        </p>

    With all of this in place, remembering the most quintessential first step of getting your very own UNVAXXED $SPRM,

    It's time to DETOX and PURIFY! And of course, all of this was juuuust a joke!
